# This is my solution to the Expense tracker challenge. 

# Sadly I am only a beginner so I am pretty bad with responsive design as this is my second project attempting to grasp media queries. 

# the graph was made with Chart.js so I am unsure if this will load on github pages. using CDN so should work correctly. 

# Things i can work on better for next time is NPM using node as I firstly tried to install Chart.js via npm and required it in my App.js however from there I was stuck
and didnt know how to progress so I reverted to using this via CDN and inline javascript in the html file which I cant imagine is best practice and looks hard to read and messy.

Thank you!
